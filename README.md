In this paper, we proposed a learning based real-time down-sampling method for swarm-search mission and validated its performance on the Bayes-Swarm algorithm for several environments. Here, first we provide detailed mathematical formulation of the baselines provided in the paper. Following that, we have provided analysis of the effect of the parameters affecting down-sampling on the algorithm.

**The codes for test environment-2 with CNN-BayesSwarm along with baseline down-samplers are in test_env folder.**

**The codes to train a CNN architecture using our low-fidelity training environment are in train_env folder.**
